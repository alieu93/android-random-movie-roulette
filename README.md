# Android Random Movie Roulette
A simple Android Application that chooses a movie at complete random using The Movie Database (TMDb) API database, which has thousands of movies in their database.

# Feature:
At the moment, it is a simple Android page containing a button that makes an API call to TMDb using a randomly generated id and retrieves that movie's information

In the future, I intend to augment the query to filter for categories such as genre, year of release, etc.

# Technologies and methodologies used:
- Glide
- Coroutines
- Retrofit with Moshi JSON Parsing
- MVVM with Data Binding
